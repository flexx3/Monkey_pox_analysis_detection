# Monkey_pox_analysis_detection
This project aims at tracking trends of monkeypox cases  around the world with the hope of containing its spread and abruptly stopping  it.
Data is sourced from European Center For Disease Control(ECDC), Kaggle.
Technologies used includes Python packages;pandas,pandas_profilling,seaborn,matplotlib,plotly,word cloud,scikit-learn.
This project was quite challenging due to the nature of the data; lots of missing values,inconsistent and mislaced data ie my data cleaning skills was really pushed.
I tested some algorithms on the dataset and it turns out that decision trees performed better.
